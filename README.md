# School-District-Analysis

The purpose of this challenge is to replace the data that is not accurate at Thomas High School while we keep the rest of the data the same way and create the same analysis we did in the in the activities of the module. We would like to analyze our data including the total school budget, per student capita, average math and reading score, the passing percent for math and reading, and the overall passing percentage and get very deep in the analysis for Thomas High school.
