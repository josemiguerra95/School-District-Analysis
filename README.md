## Summary

The changes that occurred in the analysis are the number of students, average math scores, average reading scores and the percentage of students that approved in reading and math at Thomas High school. Since the whole data set was decreased by removing the students of 9th grade and filtering only by Thomas High school. This leads to the outcomes already mentioned.
